get more familiar using dpkg as my package manager for installed packages, and pacman + yay + flatpak as installers + updaters. Try using dpkg for the installed packages instead of packman (will have to update both import and export).
Define list of package installers/updates per system in terms of preference i.e. on arch pacman > flatpak > yay
are there any settings for pacman, apt, yay and flatpak to only download latest packages if they're a week old? (to avoid supply chain attacks?) (If the latest is under a week, then grab the previous version, if it's over a week, etc.) (Claude says no, can add it via pr?)
